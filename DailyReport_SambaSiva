DAY 13 : 29/05/2015 : Automate the process of resolving Client-side dependencies : Completed Javascript learning
DAY 14 : 01/06/2015 : Automate the process of resolving Client-side dependencies : Studied previous javaScript codes which lists plugins installed and PC configuration
DAY 15 : 02/06/2015 : Automate the process of resolving Client-side dependencies : Started writing code that takes txt file as input and gives the list of required plugins to be installed. 
DAY 16 : 03/06/2015 : Learnt Shell Script and Started writing code to read text-file and try to install software in it.
DAY 17 : 04/06/2015 : Learnt Shell Script and Started writing code to read text-file and try to install software in it.Studied and Installed Apache server.
